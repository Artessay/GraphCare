spondylosis	is a type of	degenerative disc disease
intervertebral disc disorders	can cause	back pain
other back problems	include	sciatica
sciatica	can result in	leg pain
physical therapy	is a treatment for	spondylosis
spondylosis	can lead to	spinal stenosis
spinal stenosis	causes	compression of nerves
compression of nerves	can result in	numbness and weakness
spondylosis	is often diagnosed by	MRI imaging
spondylosis	is associated with	aging
aging	is a risk factor for	spondylosis
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs	are used to	manage pain in spondylosis
spondylosis	increases the risk of	osteoarthritis
osteoarthritis	can cause	joint pain
spondylosis	is linked to	herniated discs
herniated discs	cause	nerve compression
spondylosis	can lead to	disability
disability	may require	assistive devices
spondylosis	is a common cause of	chronic low back pain
chronic low back pain	is often treated with	opioid medications
obesity	is a risk factor for	spondylosis
spondylosis	can result in	loss of spinal flexibility
loss of spinal flexibility	may lead to	poor posture
poor posture	can exacerbate	spondylosis
spondylosis	can be a result of	repetitive stress on the spine
repetitive stress on the spine	is common in	certain occupations
spondylosis	can cause	radiculopathy
radiculopathy	is characterized by	radiating pain
spondylosis	is a common cause of	spinal fusion surgery
spinal fusion surgery	is used to	stabilize the spine
spondylosis	can lead to	loss of mobility
loss of mobility	increases the risk of	falls
falls	can result in	fractures
fractures	can lead to	chronic pain
spondylosis	is associated with	reduced quality of life
reduced quality of life	may lead to	depression
depression	can exacerbate	perception of pain
spondylosis	has a higher prevalence in	certain genetic populations
certain genetic populations	are at higher risk for	spondylosis
spondylosis	is more common in	individuals with sedentary lifestyles
sedentary lifestyles	contribute to	weakened back muscles
spondylosis	can result in	spinal instability
spinal instability	may require	surgical intervention
spondylosis	is often managed with	lifestyle modifications
lifestyle modifications	include	weight management
weight management	is important for	reducing strain on the spine
spondylosis	is a leading cause of	disability in older adults
older adults	are at higher risk for	spondylosis
spondylosis	is a chronic	condition
spondylosis	is a risk factor for	disc herniation
disc herniation	can lead to	nerve impingement
spondylosis	is associated with	reduced disc height
reduced disc height	contributes to	spinal instability
spondylosis	is often accompanied by	facet joint arthritis
facet joint arthritis	causes	joint pain and stiffness
spondylosis	can result in	decreased range of motion
decreased range of motion	may lead to	muscle imbalances
muscle imbalances	can worsen	spondylosis
spondylosis	can lead to	muscle spasms
muscle spasms	contribute to	back pain
spondylosis	is commonly associated with	loss of disc hydration
loss of disc hydration	leads to	decreased flexibility of the spine
spondylosis	is frequently seen in conjunction with	osteoporosis
osteoporosis	increases the risk of	spinal fractures
spondylosis	is characterized by	degenerative changes in the spine
degenerative changes in the spine	result in	pain and stiffness
spondylosis	is a significant cause of	healthcare utilization
healthcare utilization	includes	physician visits and diagnostic tests
spondylosis	is associated with	higher healthcare costs
higher healthcare costs	may be a result of	surgical interventions and long-term management
spondylosis	has been linked to	reduced work productivity
reduced work productivity	can lead to	financial strain
financial strain	may impact	treatment adherence
spondylosis	is a chronic	degenerative condition
spondylosis	is often managed with	multidisciplinary care
multidisciplinary care	involves	healthcare providers from various specialties
spondylosis	is a leading cause of	disability in middle-aged and older adults
middle-aged and older adults	are at higher risk for	spondylosis
spondylosis	is more prevalent in	industrialized nations
industrialized nations	have a higher incidence of	spondylosis
spondylosis	can lead to	radiculitis
radiculitis	is inflammation of	spinal nerve roots
spondylosis	can result in	vertebral bone spurs
vertebral bone spurs	can cause	nerve compression
spondylosis	is often associated with	reduced physical activity
reduced physical activity	can lead to	deconditioning and muscle weakness
deconditioning and muscle weakness	may exacerbate	spondylosis
spondylosis	may result in	reduced quality of life
reduced quality of life	can lead to	decreased social engagement
decreased social engagement	may contribute to	feelings of isolation
