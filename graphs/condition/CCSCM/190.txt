fetal distress	can lead to	abnormal forces of labor
abnormal forces of labor	may result in	birth trauma
fetal distress	is monitored using	electronic fetal monitoring
abnormal forces of labor	can cause	fetal hypoxia
fetal hypoxia	may lead to	brain damage
fetal distress	can be caused by	umbilical cord compression
umbilical cord compression	is detected using	ultrasound
abnormal forces of labor	increases the risk of	cesarean delivery
cesarean delivery	may result in	postoperative complications
fetal distress	requires	prompt intervention
umbilical cord compression	is relieved by	changing maternal position
fetal hypoxia	is treated with	oxygen therapy
fetal distress	is associated with	decreased fetal movement
decreased fetal movement	is a sign of	fetal distress
fetal distress	is linked to	placental abruption
placental abruption	leads to	decreased oxygen supply to the fetus
abnormal forces of labor	can be caused by	malposition of the baby
malposition of the baby	may necessitate	assisted delivery
abnormal forces of labor	increases the risk of	meconium aspiration
meconium aspiration	can lead to	respiratory distress in the newborn
fetal distress	is correlated with	maternal hypertension
maternal hypertension	increases the risk of	preeclampsia
fetal distress	is a complication of	preterm labor
preterm labor	requires	careful monitoring
fetal distress	can be caused by	maternal infection
maternal infection	can lead to	fetal inflammation
