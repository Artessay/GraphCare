pathological fracture	is a	type of fracture
pathological fracture	can occur in	cancer patients
radiation therapy	can cause	pathological fracture
pathological fracture	may lead to	immobility
immobility	increases the risk of	deep vein thrombosis
deep vein thrombosis	can lead to	pulmonary embolism
pulmonary embolism	can cause	death
pathological fracture	is managed with	orthopedic surgery
orthopedic surgery	may require	bone grafting
bone grafting	can be done using	autograft or allograft
autograft	uses	patient's own bone
allograft	uses	donor bone
pathological fracture	is a risk factor for	mortality
mortality	can be predicted by	age and comorbidities
age and comorbidities	affect	mortality rate
mortality rate	can be lowered with	early intervention
early intervention	includes	pain management and physical therapy
physical therapy	helps in	regaining mobility
regaining mobility	reduces the risk of	complications
complications	can lead to	hospital readmission
hospital readmission	is linked to	increased healthcare costs
increased healthcare costs	can be reduced by	preventive measures
preventive measures	include	education and support for patients and caregivers
education and support	are important for	patient outcomes
patient outcomes	can be improved with	coordinated care
coordinated care	involves	communication between healthcare providers
communication between healthcare providers	ensures	comprehensive treatment
comprehensive treatment	leads to	better prognosis
prognosis	depends on	the underlying condition and the patient's overall health
the underlying condition and the patient's overall health	determine	treatment options
treatment options	may include	chemotherapy	radiation therapy	or surgery
chemotherapy	and	radiation therapy	are used in	cancer patients with pathological fractures
surgery	is necessary for	stabilizing the bone
stabilizing the bone	can improve	quality of life
quality of life	is affected by	pain and mobility
pain and mobility	impact	daily activities
daily activities	can be adapted with	assistive devices and modifications
assistive devices and modifications	help in	maintaining independence
maintaining independence	is important for	mental well-being
mental well-being	influences	overall health
overall health	affects	recovery and rehabilitation
recovery and rehabilitation	are crucial for	regaining function
regaining function	requires	multidisciplinary approach
multidisciplinary approach	involves	various healthcare professionals
various healthcare professionals	collaborate in	patient care
patient care	should be personalized to	individual needs
individual needs	are unique for	each patient
each patient	requires	tailored treatment plan
tailored treatment plan	considers	patient's preferences and goals
patient's preferences and goals	impact	treatment adherence
treatment adherence	is essential for	successful outcome
successful outcome	is the ultimate goal of	healthcare management
