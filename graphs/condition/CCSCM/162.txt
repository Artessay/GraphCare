other diseases of bladder and urethra	can lead to	urinary retention
urinary retention	may require	catheterization
catheterization	increases risk of	urinary tract infection
urinary tract infection	can lead to	sepsis
sepsis	can cause	organ failure
organ failure	increases risk of	mortality
other diseases of bladder and urethra	can present with	hematuria
hematuria	is a sign of	bladder cancer
bladder cancer	may require	surgical intervention
surgical intervention	can lead to	complications
complications	may require	prolonged hospitalization
prolonged hospitalization	increases risk of	hospital-acquired infections
hospital-acquired infections	can lead to	readmission
readmission	is associated with	healthcare costs
other diseases of bladder and urethra	can be diagnosed with	cystoscopy
cystoscopy	allows visualization of	bladder and urethra
bladder and urethra	can be affected by	inflammation
inflammation	can be treated with	anti-inflammatory drugs
anti-inflammatory drugs	may cause	gastrointestinal side effects
gastrointestinal side effects	may lead to	medication discontinuation
medication discontinuation	can lead to	disease progression
disease progression	can result in	worsening symptoms
worsening symptoms	may require	additional interventions
additional interventions	can lead to	improved outcomes
improved outcomes	are associated with	better quality of life
other diseases of bladder and urethra	can be managed with	physical therapy
physical therapy	can improve	bladder control
bladder control	is important for	urinary function
urinary function	affects	quality of life
quality of life	is a predictor of	patient satisfaction
patient satisfaction	is associated with	treatment compliance
treatment compliance	is essential for	disease management
disease management	aims to	improve symptoms
symptoms	can be monitored with	regular follow-up
regular follow-up	allows for	early intervention
early intervention	can prevent	complications
complications	may require	hospitalization
hospitalization	is associated with	healthcare resource utilization
healthcare resource utilization	impacts	healthcare costs
healthcare costs	are influenced by	insurance coverage
insurance coverage	affects	access to care
access to care	may impact	health outcomes
health outcomes	are important for	patient well-being
patient well-being	is linked to	overall satisfaction
overall satisfaction	can influence	healthcare utilization
healthcare utilization	affects	healthcare system capacity
healthcare system capacity	is relevant for	public health
public health	is determined by	disease burden
disease burden	is influenced by	prevalence
prevalence	can be affected by	screening programs
screening programs	aim to	detect disease early
early detection	is crucial for	effective treatment
effective treatment	can lead to	better prognosis
better prognosis	depends on	disease stage
disease stage	determines	treatment options
treatment options	should be based on	individual needs
individual needs	vary depending on	patient factors
patient factors	include	age and comorbidities
comorbidities	can impact	treatment outcomes
treatment outcomes	influence	patient satisfaction
patient satisfaction	is related to	healthcare experience
healthcare experience	is influenced by	communication with healthcare providers
communication with healthcare providers	is important for	shared decision-making
shared decision-making	involves	patient preferences
patient preferences	should be considered in	treatment planning
treatment planning	should prioritize	patient-centered care
